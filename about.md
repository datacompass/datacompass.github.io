This page originated as a blog about the current practices of mathematical education in American public schools. To make the effort more constructive, however, the author added a series of problems, called "Kids' math," hoping to show that (1) your kids can do them and enjoy the learning experience, with all its questions and diversions, and (2) real mathematics is not about crunching numbers or "breaking a problem into steps." In particular, you will notice that most problems have no explicit dealing with numbers, yet teach good mathematics.
